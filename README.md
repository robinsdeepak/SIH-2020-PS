| Description |
|-------------|


|An excavator is a construction vehicle used to excavate or move large objects. The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement.The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm & bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick.  The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel  joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM's.When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available. A new regeneration scheme to recover these energies to reduce the power loss and energy /fuel saving. The total potential energy could be regenerated under the standard operating conditions in the proposed system should be more energy efficient at least 30~40% of existing system.Outcome expected: 1.	Propose alternative Design for energy efficient Regenerative Hydraulic system for 100 ton Excavator.2.	Alternative concept and features should meet or exceed the hydraulic system efficiency of  current hydraulic system.3.	Concept needs to be described with block diagram and working principle indicating regeneration of hydraulic energy to be described in hydraulic system line diagram.4.

|Problem_Statement_Title | Timing error estimation and matched filtering are crucial processing blocks in a communication receiver. The problem is like looking for the occurrence of a known signal in the observed/measured signal, which is noisy and distorted. This nature of problem makes it best suited for intelligent approach, as human brain invariably solves this kind of problem in day-to-day life. Classical techniques like maximum likelihood, Early-Late, Gardener and Muller approaches have been successfully implemented. However, it is perceived that machine learning techniques will outperform the classical approaches and this fact needs to be researched. The neural network shall use minimum computation and converge fast for practical and real-time implementation. If the results are promising, it can be applied for military and commercial radars. |

|“Upgrading 3G Mobile for LTE/4G network- There are many user with 3G handset who are using mobile servicesmainly for voice communications. For example senior citizens, school students/kids (phone given by parents tobe in touch in case of emergency or to just convey the status in reaching or leaving school) helpers(maid/servants). However, with roll out of LTE/4G network by major telecom operators and voice service (by VoLTE)at much cheaper cost such subscribers are forced to but a new LTE/4G mobile or to forego such benefits. It may beworthwhile to explore the possibility of upgrading the 3G mobile handset which already support packet datafunctionality, to LTE/4G mobile and to start with focus may be limited to the VoLTE capability along if the cost ofsolution with software upgrades and hardware (w.r.t. RF part) vis-avis a new LTE mobile is quite low, it will also helpin reducing the e-waste or recycling of 3G/4G mobile phones.”|

|Lack of dynamic crop maps and opacity in water utilisation data prevents proper water accounting at the level of irrigation commands. Information regarding area under various crops is generally available at an aggregate level e.g. district wise cultivated area under individual crops. Non-availability ofactual crop maps preventsspatial visualisation of water utilisation and therefore proper water accounting. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad generates yearly Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps at a finer resolution of 56m containing land use classes of crop season and number of crops (single/multiple crop). Crowdsourced information from farmers, agricultural extension service providers, local administration and local population may be used for generation of crop type maps for a particular irrigation season which in turn may be used for preparation of water accounts at various spatial scales rangingfrom command of a major to minor irrigation project. Water Accounting at various spatial and temporal scales in commands of irrigation projects will help in informed decision making during the ensuing crop season and leads to optimal utilisation of irrigation water.|

|1.	Surat has emerged as a hub of fabric printing, as this activity is associated with the processing activity and is a value add over and above processing2.	With over 500 process houses in and around Surat, printing has been a natural extension to value addition for all the process houses. Most of them have at least 4 printing machines, with capacity to print about 3000 to 30000 meters per machine per day depending upon the design.3.	There exists a business opportunity for having small sized digital partners synchronized with the existing equipment to get value added output at one go, while most of the printers are imported, industry also plans to develop a prototype of Indian made printing machine in the long run.4.	Surat leads in multi-color design printing on fabrics. It can become a hub for digital and Laster fabric printing for the world, should the units be equipped with printing equipment of varied sizes.5.	The equipment for printing machines is an equally important area, in which the industry currently is looking for solutions, color transfer pump systems on a printing machines are the heart of the printer. The improvement to such systems is explained herein below: (5.1) current scenario – the color feeding systems to the printing machines is manual in nature. This results in wastage of expensive printing colors by 25% to 30% as the process is dependent on human intervention. Apart from the wastage aspect, there is also more water required for washing which not only leads to higher costs, but has an adverse environmental impact.(5.2) proposed changes- the industry is exploring design of an auto color feeding system, using pneumatic or gear based pumps. This will lead to reduced wastage, lesser use of water and meeting environmental compliances  6.	An R&D facility would be needed in Surat in order to carry out the necessary development as suggested above and come up with firm findings on which system would be better for commercialization.7.	The following graph shows the revenue projection of India’s technical textile machine manufacturing market till 2018|

| Description |
|-------------|


|To increase the transmission reliability and better service quality, connectivity through multiple links or networks, i.e., multi-homing, is considered which provides robustness and offers concurrent data transfer over multiple paths. The real-time data streaming requires low delay, jitter free transmission medium. For real-time multiplexed streams, comprising audio, video and data, the transmission reliability requirement is different for each type of stream. So, there is a need of an efficient transmission technique for such multiplexed streams with different reliability parameter settings for each stream over a multi-homed networking environment. It is also required to have a suitable handoff mechanism in case of link failover with minimum handoff latency.   The participants must design implement and demonstrate transmission protocol with point-to-point real-time Audio, video and data conferencing application over multi-homed network.DATA : Live Audio, video stream may be generated through webcam and mic. attached to a laptop/desktop machine for testing and evaluation.Data Set link:https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vcms/en/sih2020.html|

| Description |
|-------------|


|In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualized MANET protocol shall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node in searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zones such as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in the area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed to modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol. The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establishment and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be in order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devices shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used. An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.“For more clarity, email your question to pdhag@barc.gov.in”|

|Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) is a statutory organization entrusted to implement Environmental Laws and control pollution in the state of Andhra Pradesh through regulations.APPCB is presently using cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring. APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of Non-Attainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.Current System using in detailed:Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board uses cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industry categories existing in the state to be adequately monitored to check pollution in the long run.Significant indicators taken into consideration under CEMS are the emission and effluent quality standard limits as prescribed by the Board based on the industry type, category, local conditions and the characteristics of the emission and effluents by the industry.APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.|

There is a serious need of detailed research in the development of regional or national flood damage functions for pre-disaster flood damage estimation property. Risk assessment is important in making decisions, policies and managing floods. The objective of this study is to review and synthesize concepts and techniques of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment with reference to the Uttarakhand. The objective of present study is to delineate and identify flood hazard and risk assessment Banaskantha district in Gujarat, India. There is a serious need of detailed research in the development of regional or national flood damage functions for Pre-disaster flood damage estimation property. The objective of present study is to delineate and identify flood hazard and risk assessment Banaskantha district in Gujarat, India. Human beings and Animals. To delineate and identify flood hazard and risk assessment at Dhanera city of Banaskantha district in Gujarat, India. Dhanera covering total geographical area of 16 km2. Dhanera is located at 24.52°N 72.02°E. It has an average elevation of 128 meters (420 ft.). There is a serious need of detailed research in the development of regional or national flood damage functions for pre-disaster flood damage estimation property. Risk assessment is important in making decisions, policies and managing floods. The objective of this study was to review and synthesize concepts and techniques of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment with reference to the Uttarakhad. Using geo spatial technology to model and predict the magnitude of flood risk areas, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis techniques are used for this study the flooding causative factors such as rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, drainage network and density. This study aims at providing expertise for preparing flood mapping and estimating flood risks in growing urban areas.GIS and remote sensing play an important role in flood hazard, vulnerability and in risk assessment and useful for delineation of flood zones, preparation of flood hazard and risk maps The main advantage of using GIS for flood analyses is that it not only generates a visualization of flooding, but also creates potential to further analyze these events to estimate probable damage due to floods. Compared to traditional mapping, GIS enables the comparisons across spatial units; comparison across different themes by category of hazards and disasters; merging of qualitative with qualitative assessment and spatial database, based on which logical and/or numerical operations can be dynamically performed. These are grounds for concluding that GIS has an important function to play in natural hazards analyses because natural hazards are multi-dimensional phenomena, which have a spatial component.|

|Explain the general problem statement in simple terms. i)	At present, government announce scheme for different section of society and direct different departments to pass on the scheme benefits to the beneficiaries, but most beneficiaries  are not aware of those schemes and middle man take advantage of such gaps.ii)	Many website provide such information about schemes but beneficiaries do not go to internet and search for the schemes. They simply rely on the communication from well-wishers or middle man. iii)	Today no mechanism is in place to directly provide the benefits to the respective users.  iv)	Lot of funds came back unutilized.   The users of this system are two-fold:i)	User who want to avail schemes has to fill certain details on KIOSK/POS terminal, and they will get all relevant applicable schemes in return. They can then update Aadhar card details which will actually link it to the schemes and government will know directly who want to avail the scheme. ii)	Approver can validate the Aadhar card and once approved, benefits can be passed on to the beneficiary without any middle man.Technology that can address this issue partially.i)	A multilingual Self operated, or supervised KIOSK preloaded with online application which will be linked to the government site like https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/schemes and can also notify relevant department to approve and give benefits to beneficiary. ii)	Basic web base multilingual application can be easily built with minimum efforts.iii)	If scheme is related to reimbursement or some monitory help, it will be transferred to bank account directly, or if that is related to some product, it will be sent through logistic to the Aadhar address. Desired Outcome: i)	A transparent system and reduced corruption.ii)	Wider coverage and easy to avail benefits by user or the actual needy.iii)	Government can actually use this data online to track number of beneficiaries.A thought from the recent Issue of Soaring Onion Prices and the need to build a better forecasting mechanism;|

|In the country, groundwater caters to 80% of the irrigation water needs since 1970. Water availability is not uniform and varies from state to state. Dugwells and tubewells are the major sources for groundwater extraction. The construction of dugwells and tubewells has been an expensive affair and has been a dream for the farmers. The affordability for construction of deep wells to get the water and its socio-economic impact needs to be studied. Agriculture census and minor irrigation census data are available at an interval of 5 years. In order to get a clear picture of the land holding pattern, irrigation source, cropping pattern and depth of the wells in the different parts of the country, a comparative assessment is required in micro/macro level i.e., block/district/state/country for the previous two census.|

|Domain Bucket| Healthcare & Biomedical Devices |
|Youtube Link|  |
|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|Preoperative planning is a phase before actual surgery procedure in which the surgeon can take all the time needed to define the surgical problem, to identify fully all the anatomical and technical aspects of the procedure, and then carefully plan the solution. In order to facilitate this, the patient is assumed to be located in a coordinate system refered to as the ‘Patient Coordinate System’(PCS), whereas the surgeon has access to pre-operative medical scans(like CT/MRI etc.) of the subject in the coordinate system refered to as the ‘Image Coordinate System’(ICS). Any procedure planned in medical scans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping. The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration) between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of the surgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use of special markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICS mapping. Apart from establishing correspondances between the appearance of fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas and accurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducials or utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. The goal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm for detection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, the participants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on the skull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center of these fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system. Accruacy of their algorithm will be tested on the corresponding ground-truth values and generalization will be evaluated based on unseen test data.|

|Problem_Statement_Title | Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls |
|Domain Bucket| Security & Surveillance |
|Youtube Link|  |
|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|Steel is a widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipment in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipment may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires de-assembling, inspection and then re-assembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like X-Rays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken. Solution methodology - Light waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology. As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound. Final outcome -  A set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it. Challenges - Since wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less. It will be very difficult to detect and differentiate the sound signal obtained from the objects. Advanced signal processing technique will be required to be developed to accomplish this task.|

| Description |
|-------------|


|Sub-surface information of the ocean like the mixed layer depth (MLD), sonic layer depth (SLD), tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) etc. is very useful in wide variety of applications such as air-sea interaction studies, Naval applications, cyclone genesis and forecasting etc. This information is available either from in situ measurements or from Numerical models. In situ measurements in the ocean are quite sparse while the numerical models have inherent errors in simulating this information. Satellites provide wide spatial coverage of the oceans; however, they only give ocean surface information. Assuming that the derived quantities of the deeper ocean such as MLD, SLD, TCHP etc have signatures in the ocean surface as well, an artificial intelligence based technique linking the satellite surface observations of the ocean with these sub-surface  quantities, may be envisaged. Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and sea surface wind speed (WS) collocated with MLD, SLD, TCHP derived from in situ measurements (ARGO floats/moored buoys) can be used as training data set where we try develop a relationship between SST, SSS, SSHA, WS and the derived quantities MLD, TCHP and SLD. In this problem the participants must develop a software to generate MLD, SLD and TCHP using satellite data (SST, SSS, SSHA, WS)|

|A truly digital public transportation system for buses, trains and feeder servicesExplain the general problem statement in simple terms. v)	As the population in city grows multifold year on year the commuting times continue to grow. Whether you commute by train (metro/non-metro), bus, smart bike or on feeder services there is no one stop shop for planning your trip using public transport facilities.vi)	With raising traffic both road and rail, there is no mechanism to track the arrival / departure times, shift between different modes of transport etc.vii)	Today, the user of public transport facility has to shift between two modes of transport on an average (a train and a bus / a bus and a feeder service to the nearby work location). The uncertainty of when these services are available and how crowded it would be makes it hard plan the trip accordingly. viii)	From a government point of view, without knowing the demand at various times, it makes it hard for them to increase / decrease these services for full utilization. Hence, it is important to gauge the demand.The users of this system are two-fold:User / Traveler: An end user who uses the public transport services to plan a trip;Government Authorities: Assess and provide the services according to the need of the users and manage the services based on the demand.Technology that can address this issueiv)	A unified system that brings all modes of public transport data into a single source of truth.v)	A mobile app and website for end users to plan and book travel across multiple public transport facilities railways, bus, metro and feeder services.vi)	GPS sensors on buses, trains, feeder services where feasible and processing capabilityvii)	Payments interface to enable direct payment for the entire trip (that can be scanned for validity at the public transport being used)Technology platform recommendation i)	A cloud database with extensible featuresii)	A distributed database with scalability features iii)	Microservice orchestration platform for API integration ( Maps, regional data )  iv)	On cloud UX for creating a native Appv)	Leverage SMS API gatewayvi)	Leverage ready apps from Azure or AWS An example comparison of these services: In the UK you can manage all the local commute using the railways using “National Rail” app. This App is a one-stop-shop for users for both trains, London metro tubes, buses etc. An user can plan end to end services using this App. For our idea, some of the key customer journeys envisaged using this are.i)	Fetch schedule times of the buses / trains / feeder services individuallyii)	Book your journeyiii)	Bar code based identification of tickets purchasediv)	Real time tracking of your service (bus / train) and identify the ETA to reach your destinationv)	Set up alerts for your servicevi)	Send notifications based on channel of choice (SMS / App notifications)Desired Outcome: iv)	Usera.	Provide a seamless, one-stop, end-to-end experience when planning any tripb.	Show all available options to the user from which he can pick which ones he prefersc.	No waiting queue at the availed service facility. d.	Make bookings/reservations within this service and pay in total the entire amountv)	Governmenta.	Promote/boost railways, state bus transport corporations, sub-urban railway, metrob.	In the long run, this service can replace state wise bus transport reservation websites with a single website/app leading to huge cost savingsc.	Additional source of revenue in the form of small commission amounts per transactiond.	Provide a major source of data as the service becomes more popular which can help the Govt. to plan for roads/railways/infrastructure development in the futuree.	Help more transport based entrepreneurs and small businesses to bring their services to the public faster|

|Many UPS, Variable frequency Drives, soft starters required to install in many applications in continuous plant industries like Pharmaceuticals, chemical, agro, food, textile etc.They are the sources of harmonic generation. Because of harmonics, power quality disturbances, voltage deflection, neutral loading, requirement of higher capacity switchgears, life of switchgear decreases.Also, for neutral loading and unbalancing in the power system occurs and life of distribution devices like transformer will also decreases.Presently in market many devices like active filters, passive filters are available. But it leads to plant modifications and also its not cost effective solution. It also leads to shut down because of retrofication.Hence, task is to find out cost effective harmonic filters.Use of UPS, Variable frequency Drives, soft starters etc. is going to increase day by day. Hence harmonic generation cannot be eliminated.Problem solution is find out cost effective harmonic filters, which do not demand system modifications.Pharmaceuticals, chemical, agro, food, textile and other continuous plant industries.Cost effective harmonic filters if possible to install without system modification then it will benefit power system. Reduction in Neutral current, increase in power quality, increase in life of switch gears, cost saving in switch gear cost.Reduction in Neutral current, increase in power quality, increase in life of switch gears, cost saving in switch gear cost. Hence, efficient operation of all continuous plant industries.|

|Bhuvan - The EOS visualisation platform has large amounts of satellite data along with derived information from various sensors and collateral data. Users of Bhuvan are widely interested in downloading data and carrying out change detection analysis for each of their areas of interest as on date. Utilities for change detection on Bhuvan platform, directly using knowledge base / Deep Learning based algorithms for identifying the changes in given / selected time series data and extracting features of interest changed over time will be a very good value addition for water resources, urban dynamics, infrastructure monitoring and disaster management. This is possible only by identification / detection of features on the fly from RS images, which are more amenable for noise from different implicit processes in atmosphere and data processing algorithms. Given time series tiles of Bhuvan Imagery / RS image ( 2 dates ) the system should a)	Identify changes and highlight areas of change.b)	Extract features that are evident from image 2 and not in image1, categorise in known lists i.e. water, roads, buildings, parks, treesc)	Find features that are missing in image2 w.r.t. image 1.

|Before fully functional helicopters, in 1960's people are using helicopter turbo-propellers for vertical takeoff and landing of planes. Helicopter Turbo-props are the propellers having propulsion system mounted at tip of the blades. The major idea about this is to reduce the travel cost per passenger as turbo props are more efficient, provide high endurance than that of the normal helicopter blades and provides two times the speed to the plane. On the other hand unbearable noise is one of the issue in helicopter turbo-props. In this problem statement, students are supposed to make the working prototype of helicopter turbo-props. These propellers should be designed in such a way that, it should lift and land a foam model of an aircraft weighing 700 grams. Successful flight test of the same is mandatory for the completion of the project.|

|Back Ground:A corporate action is an event initiated by a public company that will bring an actual change to the securities—equity or debt—issued by the company. Corporate actions are typically agreed upon by a company's board of directors and authorized by the shareholders. Examples of corporate actions include stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs.Corporate action instantly impacts security valuation and hence its timely and accurate information is very critical to financial institutes and investors.Information on current, upcoming, and historical corporate action can be purchased from various data vendors like Bloomberg, ICE Data Service, Refinitiv, MarketMap, etc. which could be expensive. Alternatively, data could be freely retrieved from public webpages and company portal. Challenge with free data approach is its accuracy, reliability and completenessProblem Statement:Goal of corporate action (CA) robot is to retrieve accurate, and complete information on historical, current, and future expected corporate action in timely manner from free sources. Required features:1.	Capability of crawling public web pages to retrieve information related to historical, current, and future expected corporate action. Data could potentially be available directly on webpage or in form of downloadable file (.pdf, .docx)2.	Ability of process information available in free text format like pdf, and MS word document3.	Intelligently identify context in which data is available, like is it listed as example, or is it a real announced corporate action. We should also be able to classify CA as approved or yet to be approved corporate action.4.	Extract important information from retrieved pages/files on corporate action like – Security Identifier type (ISIN, CUSIP, Ticker, etc.), Identifier Value, corporate action type, Ex. Date, record date, pay date, payment / ratio / other key information, other relevant corporate action details etc. Example: 	ISIN: INE239A01016			Company: Nestle India		Type of CA: Interim dividend		Amount: Rs. 55 	Ex Date: 11/12/2019	Rec Date: 12/12/2019	Pay Date: 02/01/2020 5.	Build accurate, and complete data from conflicting data retrieved from multiple sources. It should continuously learn about sources which could be trusted for specific information6.	Ability to configure to look for CA on a set of securities, to all listed securities on specific exchange.7.	Robot could be configured to continuously look for new data available for relevant corporate action.|

|Develop a portal for farmer registration along with farm plan. This plan should help government agencies to monitor the life cycle crop across life cycle. In case the production fails then provide facility to report that too. Due to information asymmetry across producers and buyers there emerges a situation of distress sales, this solution may be a step to address this arbitrage situation. Additionally provide them with advisory of different activities during the farm schedule. This kind of plan helps government to plan the production and procurement plan, thereby increasing invome of farmers. If there are too many farmers producing same crop they can be recommended/incentivised to produce some other crop.|

|The state of Uttarakhand comprises of 09 hilly districts. During monsoon season the road connectivity is a major problem. Due to heavy rainfall, complete washout of roads takes place up to 50 m length, land slide in many locations disturbs the flow of traffic, natural calamity and extreme weather incidents is a matter of concern. Restoring of connectivity in the shortest possible duration is required so that small vehicles and regular traffic flow can be resumed. The major problem is the situations where there is a complete washout of trenches of 50 m of hilly road, wherein the only solution is through providing temporary bridges so that the vehicles can move. It should be a safe, durable and low-cost solution.|

|Domain Bucket| Software - Web App development |
|Youtube Link|  |
|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|The act of research sets the course for the development of any product or service. Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:a.	Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). b.	Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. c.	Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.|

|Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:1.	Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 2.	The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance.  At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better. This app will also act as a source for insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these questions to get your health score/ heart age).|

|Domain Bucket| Smart Communication |

|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|Vibration detection plays an important role in the different areas of structural health monitoring and industrial engineering. If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts I.	Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate ±5V output corresponding to ±5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.II.	An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.Thus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement. Then development of suitable Android based  mobile app to communicate to the sensor and display frequency spectrum and important vibration parameters on mobile screen.|

|Develop a machine learning model, method, architecture or appliance to reduce building energy use and emissions – A smart sensor for industrial buildings. An experienced operator can do a good job of adjusting set points and schedule. But no matter how good they are, a human’s ability is limited by the amount of data he or she can process.  Significant opportunities exist to take advantage of external data sources including real-time occupancy sensor networks, changing space schedules, weather forecasts, grid carbon intensity, and other environmental conditions that could help us better predict space set-points and schedules 24x7.  Machine learning means each forecasting instance could be improved upon, as the system would have the ability to measure the results each time it forecasts space energy demands and re-adjust predicted set points and schedules accordingly.|

|Livestock holdings are extremely fluid in nature. Ownership changes through sale and migration across different geographical areas confound the efforts to arrive at accurate estimations. Identification of livestock through suitable methods and regular recording of births, deaths and sale reduces the gap between actual and estimated values. So far, A.P. Animal Husbandry Department did not have any such software application. Hence, an app in this direction would be of potential use to the Department. Problem is : All India livestock census data base to design suitable fields to capture the dynamic events in livestock population changes. App should (1) Provide facility to operators to add,modify,delete livestock details using suitable identification mechnism during birth, sale, death (2) provide officials access to data and stats across different geographical areas.Updated!|

|Existing practice: • 	After loading booked consignments, card seals with lac imprint fastened across the closed doors using strings. They are used as security feature throughout the train journey. 	• 	Paper seals are for one time use. Wherever, the seals are found tampered, fresh seals are applied. •	RPF personnel check the seals manually en-route at different stations and record the seal position. In case of a criminal interference, these seal positions are back-traced and reconciled to fix the place of occurrence. Problems: •	Lot of human resource is wasted. •	The seal checking is not very thorough. Errors in recording the seal position cause difficulty in fixing the place of occurrence. Sometimes, the PO is incorrectly fixed due to which crime is not detected. •	The seal position is ascertained as a follow up to incidence of crime after passage of lot of time. If seal tampering is conveyed immediately, the PO would be ascertained immediately and effective response will be launched increasing prospects of detect ion of the case. Solution required: •	Has to be low cost and scalable. •	The instruments used must be reusable. •	The solution has to be simple. •	It should alert the control room of the division having jurisdiction if the seal is tampered on a running train en-route.

|Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance. Projecs intends to achive: • Determining the size of the search area from the Last Known Position (LKP), including speed, heading and attitude, of aircraft.• Determining the desired area coverage  • Selecting appropriate search patterns.|

| Description |

|The maintenance of rural and urban roads is becoming an increasing challenge as a result of the rapid growth of the network. A large amount of money is going to waste due to irregularity and improper approach. Sound asset management principles need to be introduced as an integral part of road policies and maintenance program. Comprehensive maintenance planning with schedule,institutional reforms, linkage with initial construction, maintenance backlog, utilization of fund, regular on site inspections, training to the workforce, human attitude, existing practices and knowledge of different road patterns are the major challenges in record-keeping. The maintenance and record keeping of maintenance is the key issues in the government department after the liability period over of new construction. A comprehensive system will help for planning of maintenance schedule, frame work, methodology. Also a prediction can be made for the timely maintenance fund requirements. Effective techniques can be decided for the problems. Quality of initial construction work can be achieved. It is more important to say that wastage of public fund can be reduced from the repetitive approach. Mostly, Public infrastructure is developed by the government department. It is obvious that various government bodies like municipalities, nagarpalika, panchayat and road and building department of state and central government etc. will be the potential users. Also private residential and commercial communities may use it for the maintenance records and fund estimation. A comprehensive maintenance record-keeping system will be the ready tool, which serve different aspects of complete qualitative maintenance such as, data base of complete any type of inspection on-site, recording defects including capture of images and location data to aid in repair, repair methodology applied, cost of maintenance, effective area of work, frequency of maintenance including during liability period of new constructions and fund planning for the future. It will be fruitful for the executors for social and economic development of users. Effective maintenance record keeping system will create social and economic impacts of rural roads users. It will serves ready record for long term budget planning as huge investment incurred in road infrastructure development. Some qualitative outputs such as, maintained roads provide access to where people live and important facilities such as markets, schools and health services. Good access provides the opportunity for improving livelihoods and increased employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the alleviation of poverty. Although it may be argued that the link between rural roads and poverty alleviation is mostly indirect, experience clearly shows that areas with poor road access are generally more disadvantaged than areas that are better served. The web application will contain an effective dashboard (visualization like a BI tool) which will provide different kinds of analysis , in order to take quick actions and to avoid spending excessive time in analysing this information. The application will be an effective tool as it will help save time and provide valuable information at a go to thus avoid wastage of public resource.|

|Due to the pollution on the rise, food habits and hectic schedules we are getting more and more prone to health-related issues for which many a times we use antibiotics drugs. Antibiotic resistance on the rise—and predicted to kill 10 million people per year by 2050. Do think of this problem in India context, lack of knowledge, how antibiotics are prescribed, how to gather the usage of antibiotics across the country and how to mitigate the challenge. Idea would be to see what all are the most common antibiotics / salt in those drugs are being used, for what all diseases they are being prescribed for and predict what are the probable antibiotic drugs ( salts ) which would become non-effective after a certain time for curing a specific microbial infection or disease. Requirement is to build an antimicrobial stewardship platform which should be able to provide this solution.|

|Whenever a passenger enters into an airport, their credentials are checked at check in Kiosks, Entry Gates, SHA, Immigration & customs and boarding gates to validate their journey. Usually a passenger is instructed to come two hrs before for a domestic travel and four hours before an international travel. This instruction is given to passengers as their validation process might take more time than usual due to long passenger queues at each check point. The time taken by passenger to stand in a queue at a particular touch point and gets its credentials validated is called dwell time of that touch point.Hence, a mobile application based dwell time data collection and analysis at touch points of airports including check-in counters/Entry Gates/SHA/Immigration and customs/boarding gates using IOT. The Automated system needs to prompt necessary alert messages as per escalation matrix for dynamic allocation of manpower and facilities for a particular check point.What we want: • Monitoring Effective Utilization of Airport touch points• Central data base record for each dwell time data collection.• An external API integration facility to connect with existing Airport Software’s.|

|"Uttarakhand is primarily an agricultural state. The contribution of agriculture to the states domestic product is about 22.4 percent and the population dependent on agriculture for their livelihood is about 75 -85 percent. For instance, As per Uttarakhand state planning Commission, 2007, the productivity of wheat in the hills is 13.2 quintals/hectare and rice is 12.36 quintals/hectare. Thus, agricultural opportunities are developing rapidly in the state. Especially, in sector of organic agriculture, Uttarakhand Is highly accessible because of largely rain-fed agriculture and very low use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the produce grown by farmer in the area are not only rich in nutrients but also have high medicinal value and provides an opportunity to develop and farmer friendly environment of organic farming that provide better value in the market to Small and Marginal Land holder. The various project of Department of rural development and agriculture are continuously in the process of enhancing farmer and self-help groups (SHGs) livelihoods by adding value in their produce and providing favourable markets.Provide technology based interventions like Techniques of Value addition to agriculture produce, Packaging, Logistic movement, Farmer Branding and marketing avenues. This platform should enable direct movement of farmer to the consumer and reduce the intermediates who take away a lion's share of commission."|

|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant.  N.B:        	•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces. Operation:A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.  C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made. Problems:The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.Improvements Desired:To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)Information on availability of vehicle.Live metal temperature data from ladle.Vehicle call request with location.Driver acknowledgement for call request.Vehicle identification through code broadcast.The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.|

| Description |
|-------------|


|BACKGROUND:Advances in technology have enabled large-scale harnessing of sources of renewable energy (solar, wind etc.).  Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables real-time demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed.  Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management.  For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast.  Literature proposes various learning-based forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demand-supply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.PROBLEM STATEMENT:1.	Simulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers.2.	For the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forums-develop energy generation forecasting models. 3.	For the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forums-develop energy demand forecasting models. 4.	Develop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller.5.	Integrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1.6.	Prototype the following use case with developed models: An Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time. The manager will require a dashboard that provides a micro- and macroscopic spatio-temporal trend of: (a) consumer demand maps; (b) prosumer supply; (c) solar/wind energy generated; (d) conventional energy generated; (e) outages; (f) accuracies of forecasting models for energy demand and energy generated (conventional and renewable); (g) scheduling decision report.OUTCOME EXPECTED:1.	A microgrid simulation model (with scheduling strategy integrated at controller).2.	Forecasting models to predict demand, renewable energy generated. (possibly Statistical/Machine Learning models).3.	Scheduling strategy/algorithm to manage resources to meet demands. (optimization algorithm based on forecasting model of demand and generation).4.	A web-application of the dashboard with appropriate visualizations and reports.

Design an efficient biometric tracking tool that tracks daily attendance, as well as in and out movement of children from the respective institutions. Additionally, also tracks guardian visits in the system. Design a centralized system that enables tracking attendance and guardian visit across India. Ensure that this system also works in an offline manner. For example, if database is synced once then it should allow marking of attendance and guardian visit without having to sync the database. However, the attendance should be uploaded automatically once internet connection is available. The monthly grant will be sent only if the data is synced. Provide login to District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) and Child Welfare Committees (CWC) to enable them to access the tracking information. Provide facility to transfer child from one organization to other seamlessly without losing the past tracking information. Depending on the attendance and number of visits by guardian, provide recommendation on adoption eligibility of the child based on JJ Act of 2015 and Adoption Guidelines of 2017. Based on the recommendation, flag the children with higher eligibility to be moved to the legal adoption pool. Currently, a lot of eligible children are not being moved to the legal adoption pool and hence, their right to good family is being violated.|

|Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) or Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) is a nation-wide campaign in India that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, urban and rural areas. With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat” One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat” Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of Wi-Fi 6 access points - the Catalyst 9120 is truly multi-lingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols. In addition to delivering Wi-Fi, the 9120 AP also delivers Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread capabilities with the ability to add other radios via a USB interface. The Catalyst 9120 AP also has the unique capability of executing Docker-style containerized applications that could make use of the IoT radios and deliver use cases through a unified wireless infrastructure for customers, thereby reducing cost and complexity. Cisco would love you to think audaciously about other problem statements and use cases that can leverage such a converged wireless multi-protocol capability with containerized edge applications. Cisco look forward to seeing your creations! Applications can be prototyped using a Raspberry Pi with 2 different radios. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria 1. Depth and research to understand how technology can be used for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) 2. Depth of understanding of Cisco 9120 AP product capabilities & use cases. 3. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution.Resources: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9120ax-series-access-points/datasheet-c78-742115.html|

|Brief concept behind the problem statement - Niruha Basti (Medicated Enema) is a uniform mixture of Honey, Salt, Sneha (Oil/Ghee), Kalka (Herbal paste) and Kwatha (Herbal Decoction).The ingredients of basti dravya are to be mixed in specific order to obtain the perfect mixture. Honey and rock salt were mixed together in the beginning followed by addition of Sesame oil. This mixture was then thoroughly mixed. The finely wet grinded paste of Herbal drugs was then mixed in it thoroughly. The decoction of herbal drugs is then added to it and the mixture was subjected to thorough churning in a domestic mixer to produce a homogeneous mixture. The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion.Solution – If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl  made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speed There should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug.The automatic blender should be pre- programmed for each ingredient to be instilled into the bowl/mortar in a specific measurable amount ( as per the percentage of each ingredient required in the final product) automatically at a specific interval with the help of a set self- timer attched into it.This will not only help making Basti/ Enema conveniently but also will  prevent individual differences in final Basti by making a standard final manufactured Basti.|

|Summary Energy sector has changed over the last 20 years. Renewable energy business is up and running Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in these dynamics. Internet of Things economy is expected to gain another 43% by 2022 according to International Energy Agency.As simple as they look, wind turbines are extremely complex constructions often placed in wild conditions—open sea and faraway fields. In order to stay efficient and work at full potential, wind farms should be able to promptly adjust to the changing environment. Not to mention the importance of timely maintenance. IoT and energy solutions—sensor-based technology, analytics for important datum on weather and environment condition and turbine health including blade ejection due to loosening of the bolts. —help automate the management of wind farms, optimize maintenance and thus reduce the cost dramatically.Explain the general problem statement in simple terms. •	Maximize the Turbine Power Generation •	Un-availability of real time data from wind turbines •	Delayed detection of mechanical and structural faults •	Delayed order placements of spares/replacements •	Reliance on manual inspection of every turbine The users of this system are two-fold:The distribution utility manager wants to monitor all the electrical wind turbine /transformers, so that he can maximize the turbine power generation. He wanted to track the real time health of all parts of turbine including generator, blades etc., live parameters monitored such as wind direction , temperature, current, voltage etc. on a geographical map, so that he can assign a repair crew member to resolve the issue on the open notification. The manager also wants to know the historical information to all the parameters being monitored to analyze the root cause of the failure and to predict the future outages. He also wants analytical dashboards which helps in the decision making process. However, the manager wants to make his decisions as per the smart data available i.e. live sensor data, historical sensor data, device metadata Technology that can address this issue partially.SAP Leonardo with S/4 Digital Core Since SAP Leonardo site on top of S/4 HANA, it easily integrates with S/4 Digital Core so that it will start reading Wind Turbine real time sensor data at one side and processing business transactions and applications at other. SAP Leonardo enables users to receive instant notifications of any failure events happening at Turbine Tower. When any issue rises such as oil leakage or break down, Leonardo will search for extra available spare part from S/4 Digital Core’s Warehouse Management Component.  If a spare part exists in the S/4 warehouse, Leonardo will process a PTO (Pick Transfer Order) and assign a work order to nearest technician to a tower using his/her GPS coordinates. A technician will pick up the spare part from warehouse and fix the turbine issue. In case if Leonardo does not find spare part in S/4 Warehouse Component, it will automatically place a Purchase Order to a Vendor and maintain its record in a custom Z table. Once a factory user performs a GR (Goods Receive) for spare part through SAP t-code MIGO, Leonardo will check its existence in custom created Z table & if found, it will automatically create and assign a new work order to a technician. This integrated automation will drastically save time for troubleshooting & maximize the Turbine Power generationDesired Outcome: •	Cost efficiency in maintaining and servicing wind turbines •	Immediate order placement in case of inventory exhaustion. •	To maintain the desired power output from wind farm to grid •	Maximize the Turbine Power Generation •	Real time insights of mechanical failures in wind turbines •	Data Analysis of downtime and its causes •	Pattern analysis thereby enabling better forecast|

|At present efforts are made to revise and upgrade the curriculum by the AICTE to train the students to cater to industrial needs.But there are several factors that prevents the students to reach their zenith and harness their skills as below:1. Socio-economic background of the student.2. Peer influence3. Addiction to cell phones and social media.4. parents pressure to join a course in which the student is not interested.5. lack of strong foundation in the fundamentals.6. General prevalence of Learning Disability.The current metrics of CGPA, certificates are not enough to accurately assess the capability of a student. many students are sacked from the company after one or two years because they are not happy with the performance. Exact Problem:Every individual has an inherent ability /talent. if only he/she gets a job suiting the skill set the goal of AICTE will be achieved. Higher productivity will be there and youth power has a major role to play in a Nation's growth . Economy will improve. The proposed software should identify the skill set and assess the capacity of a student. It should recommend the suitable candidates against a requirement from the industry.|

|UAV's for Disaster Hardware. When manmade or natural disasters like a flood or earthquake, etc. happen, it can be extremely dangerous to send first responders in, even though there is an Alerting System Software for people who badly need help. Drones are useful and are helping in the recovery after the disaster, but most require individual pilots, who fly the unmanned aircraft by remote control. That limits how quickly rescuers can view an entire affected area, and can delay actual aid from reaching victims. Autonomous smart drones with integrated image processing APIs that have a longer flight time and can relay real time analysis of images to remote locations will help in early detection and adequate mobilization of resources.|

The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.   OUTCOME EXPECTED: 1. Application runs on Android and IOS app which is directly integrated with traffic control team.  2. Distributed way of traffic maintenance.

|Domain Bucket| Robotics & Drones |
|Youtube Link|  |
|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|(a)	Statement of the Problem. Ships use fuel, oils, sludge, sewage, water and other fluids, which are stored in tanks. When stored in tanks, these fluids tend to stick inside the tanks forming layers of semi-solid substance. Moreover, many impurities of these fluids settle down and stick to the surface of the tanks. It is therefore imperative that the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis on ships.Generally, tanks cleaning on the ship is done during dry dock and whenever the inspection of the tanks is due. Cleaning is done for inspection or if there is any work to be done inside the tanks such as cracks, leaks, etc.Tank cleaning inspection and repairs is a necessary procedure performed on board ships. This process, when carried out by humans, tends to be hazardous, sometimes leading to explosion and accidents. In spite of all the necessary safety precautions and enclosed space entry procedures, accidents still occur while inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks on board ships.(b)	How it is being Overcome.The problem is, at present, being overcome by ventilating the tanks and use of personnel protective gears. However, the atmosphere in the tanks still remains unsatisfactory and continues to pose health hazards for human beings.The following procedure is followed before making an entry for tank cleaning: -•	Fluid Contents of the tank should be removed as practicable as possible and stripped thoroughly before entering.•	Ventilate the tank using thorough ventilation or forced ventilation method and make the tank suitable for man entry.•	Before making a man entry, the atmosphere of the tank is tested for percentage of oxygen and availability of any toxic gases. This has to be done using remote access if possible, otherwise the person entering the tank for testing atmosphere must wear a breathing apparatus.•	Various levels and compartments of tank is tested for the percentage of oxygen and availability of toxic gases. A multi gas analyser is used and a person who is trained and has the knowledge of using such equipment carries out the inspection.Once the tank is found safe for man entry, workers enter the tank and carry out cleaning, inspection, repairs etc. Working within these constrained spaces is hazardous, in spite of all the safety precautions.4.	Why it is Important to Solve.  Effective solution of this problem is critical to avoid (a)	time delays in inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks (b)	accidents which still occur inside the tanks on board ships. (c)	manpower cost.5.	Suggested Solutions. The problem can be resolved by developing a mechanism like a robotic arm with the following attachments:(a)	Gas analyser for checking the percentage of oxygen and presence of toxic gases, (b)	Camera for inspection of tank and examination of defect.(c)	Cleaning Attachment(d)	Repair attachments(e)	Quality Inspection EquipmentThe robotic arm should be amenable for reliable operation on a ship and capable of entering the tanks and reaching all areas within. It should have programmable operations like horizontal movement, vertical movement, speed adjustment, single or multistage operation at any desired length and angle range, etc. It should be light enough to carry within the constraints of a ship, with fixing arrangements that match with arrangements on-board ship.|

Use of pesticides, fertilizers, dumping of e-waste such as batteries, plastic, etc has lead to such high levels of contamination of water that consumption of it has resulted in outbreak of diseases such as cancer. These contaminants could be visible or non-visible to eyes. Hence the problem statement is to develop a device that would help us measure the purity of water by checking the amount of pollutants, harmful chemicals, plastic molecules, microorganism. Desirable limits of drinking water parameters can be referred from Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) standard specifications.|

|Under MGNREGA, wage payment is made to workers doing unskilled work and subsequent creation of assets. A musterroll is prepared (consisting of list of workers who are working on a particular asset/work ) and attendance is entered.Based on no of days attended/worked, the payment is released.Currently capturing of attendance is a manual process where a physical entry is made by the work supervisor and noproper attendance tracking is done. There is no checking or effective/efficient verification process involved.An intelligent attendance solution is desired to be developed (out of the box thinking will be appreciated ad not justlimited to a Mobile App based solution) which is feasible, less complex in implementation, address all challenges andeliminates the gaps in current system promoting transparency and less corruption/fraudulent entries. The systemdeveloped/proposed should be fool proof, preferred automated with minimal manual intervention. Latest technologicalinterventions (use of Advanced Analytics, BI, AI, Machine learning etc.) should be referenced for developing a state ofthe art solutionSample Data Required: No|

|Background: Today organizations have multiple tools and systems to help assist them in their day to day software development activities. There is need of a system which can connect to applications, mine & analyze data and provide results to stakeholders whenever they need it.Problem Statement:  For example, questions to assist development activities could be:What is the status of the release of Project X that was due this Friday?Why was Feature Y not fulfilled in the last release for Project X?How many test cases failed in the last release of Project X?Send me an email with the last release notes for Project XHow to install Project X?How was Feature Z implemented? (Note: the robot would need to connect to all the applications, and dig out all the relevant information (description of features and linked commits / comments /guides) related the Feature ZHelp me solve the class not found exception against “ClassName” (Note: this would mean running a query on stack overflow)Create an AI/ML based application to be hosted within a corporate/organization intranet with complete access to corporate/organization resources of JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket and Stack Overflow.The primary responsibility of this software robot (Intelligent Product Master - IPM) is to learn-mine-analyze-serve information about a product to optimize development and support processes in a product team. IPM’s input interfaces would be a mic and email to receive input from users.IPM’s output interfaces would be speaker and email to revert to users.Following are the two main use cases (but not limited to)1. Anyone can ask/look up for any information to IPM. It responds with accurate answer by voice-to-text-conversion/email. Mining existing data (could use APIs of the information hosting applications). Co-relating multiple information, analyzes and respond text-to-voice/email.2. Take the Speaker in a meeting (example: scrum ceremonies/meetings). It records the meeting MOM in detail in its own data-reservoir (database). The scrum master can also instruct IPM to do multiple activity during the meeting. Say: Create a jira task, pull out the last updated jira task. Send me the last email from XYZ to me etc.To implement this, you can use a computer/speak/mail server and client, Voice-text-voice converter, text to jira / confluence / bitbucket / Stack Overflow APIs, AI to Analyze data to get accurate information, ML to learn when taken in a meeting. The key challenges in the problem would be to architect an information store that is optimally designed to answer queries, and accurately answer questions posed to it. For voice to text, and text to voice, you may use standard (free) libraries/services available in the market.|

|Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces.Solution Expected: The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism.1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system.2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger.Tech recommendation:  The Conversational AI Playbook can be integrated with Webex Teams and help tourists inthe following key areas likeTravel Planner – The Chatbot must act as a virtual travel agent who is able to share the suggestions based on the users travel preferences.It should be capable to check the Hotel Room AvailabilityRecommend the right package based on tourist profile.Keep tourist informed about the details of the journey like check ins, flight /Train status etc.Route complex queries to human agents in real time (Adventure Tourism)The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria: 1. Depth and research to understand Indian Tourism Industry (Domain Knowledge)2. Depth of understanding of Mind meld capabilities & Business model use cases. 4. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution, e.g. Mindmeld &WebEx Teams botResources: https://www.mindmeld.com/docs/integrations/webex_teams.htmlhttps://www.mindmeld.com/docs/blueprints/overview.html|

We could potentially use Drones for last mile delivery of items. While current prevalent addressing mechanism such as lat/long and post code are good enough for humans, these won’t work for drone delivery as all houses in a multi-storey building will have same lat/long or post-code. Design a solution which can help drones to identify each address / flat as a separate unit and deliver the item accordingly.|

|Youtube Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Of the 70 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide, nearly 12 million PWE are expected to reside in India; which contributes to nearly one-sixth of the global burden. Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation. Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost, portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family members or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn’t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures. The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body. The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions, continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.|

|The effects of low prey density in the forest due to natural or man created situation, deforestation and human intervention is causing animal migration towards the human habitats especially in the areas which come in forest territory. As per the survey report of FRI Dehradun, Uttarakhand, The State of Uttarkhand recorded forest area of 38,000 Sq km which is 71.05% of its total geographical area of 53,483 Sq km that is largely facing the real issue of human-animal conflict. The animals are crossing the borders and destroying the agricultural crop of small and marginal famers in hilly areas of Uttarakhand. A published report of  'Wildlife management, Uttarakhand Forest Government of Uttarakhand' reported that the rate of human —animal highly being seen during cultivated time. The highly encountered wild animals at this time are — monkeys and wild boars, they destroy the agriculture cash crops such as — rice, pulses, wheat and vegetables, etc. The issue is raising agricultural disinterest amongst small and marginal farmers and directly impacting their livelihoods. To sustain interest of small and marginal farmers in hilly areas of Uttarakhand, requires technological intervention for protection of their agriculture crops from wild animals.|

Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. Solution Expected: As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging. Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve: Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing & Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the scalability factor of the system. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria: 1. Depth and research to understand Mid-Day meal scheme monitoring problem. 2. Depth of understanding of Meraki camera product capabilities use cases. 3. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution.Resources: https://developer.cisco.com/meraki https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/CiscoDevNet/Object-detection-via-Meraki-Camera https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/mv-sense/|

|Education Department Govt of Sikkim, every year conduct STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) exam for all categories of teachers Primary Teacher, Graduate Teacher and Post Graduate Teacher before the recruitment exam. All the eligible candidates will apply for STET, so the applicants will be almost 5000. Checking all the documents, verifying them and issuing admit cards to individual candidate manually is a difficult job, which we are carrying for many years. During this span of time we made human error and had to repeat the processes. What we want : To make the STET exam error free and quick solution, we are in need of online software or window where candidates can login, register, fill the form and submit. Software should keep bio data of the candidate, print admits cards and later we can display online result of STET as well. During all the process automatic SMS and Email facilities should be included. Mobile app will be more convenient along with software. Challenges Network connectivity is not uniform all throughout the state of Sikkim so software should be develop in such a way that it can run with less network ,that is it can open only that window which candidate wants.Design a application that integrates with some reliable system like DigiLocker for verification of documents, or accept documents signed by DigiLocker eSign for document verification. Reduce manual intervention wherever possible, manual verification should be done only when final offer letter is to be issued.|

|India is a developing country with a steep rise in population but a fall in the cultivable land area. India is able to produce enough food to feed the people. However, it stands 97th in Oxfam’s Food Availability Index, and 103rd in the 2018 Global Hunger Index. The major cause could be the wastage of food produced at various levels. With the constant rise in population, India will have to smartly manage its food resources. We have to develop smart management techniques for food storage and reduce the wastage. Develop an application to provide a network of ware houses and farmers. Engage a logistic provider network to enable farmers directly use the network to sell their produce. Additionally provide facility to access warehouses and cold storages. Such a network will also enable judging whether enough storage capacity is available and also provide optimal usage of the facilities available.|

| Description |
|-------------|


|Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day. Key Constraints: User adjustable temperature Automated temperature control to set temperature “ Range 20°C -40°C”. Quick response to set temperature within 3 min.Mattress/Pad material:- Radiolucency , MR Compatibility, Biocompatible and Easy to clean.Comfortable foam padMattress/pad size: 2mtr length x 0.42 mtr widthOn/Off switch and IndicatorAccurate measurement of temperature of warm mattress/bed (Tolerance +/-1 Deg)Current temperature display of the heating pad/mattress all the time.Fail safe heating mechanism-redundant temperature cut off mechanismGoal : Develop a ~2 meter long warm patient mattress/pad to provide mild warmness to patients during Imaging systems (PET/CT/MRI/Interventional Imaging Systems)|

|Though there exists a technology for face recognition based authentication, dynamic human recognition based authentication is highly challenging. For a given entrance gate a hardware-software solution is needed to identify every unique person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time, photo/videos recorded. That means there will not be a previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system should immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas, the system should learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person. For a given size of the gate, the number of cameras with optimal resolution required is also to be worked out as part of solution. The solution should be scalable and preferably based open source.|

|Problem_Statement_Title | Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data |
|Domain Bucket| Healthcare & Biomedical Devices |
|Youtube Link|  |
|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).AbstractSepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/|

|Dataset Link|  |

| Description |
|-------------|


|Traffic is the most critical problem in major cities in India. Sometimes emergency vehicle does not get route to reach at the destination due to heavy congestion on the road. Even if its desired, driver or owner of vehicle is in such a crucial position that he/she can not give space to such emergency vehicle. Emergency vehicle may be ambulance or fire-fighting equipment carrying vehicle, police van or disaster management vehicle. In emergency situation, vehicle should reach in time at proper destination but unfortunately traffic situation block that vehicle. In emergency situation like severe heat attack, pregnancy , accident, fire etc. it is necessary for a vehicle to reach at the destination in short time. In medical emergency, it is necessary to provide emergency medical treatment to the patient. It is necessary to reach at nearest and best hospital in time. Most of cities and even district place are having problem of traffic and due to which ambulance and other emergency vehicles are not getting free route to reach at the destination. Other Emergency occurs anywhere at any location, at any time, and in various ways will make one at risk such as fire. Fire fighting vehicle must reach in time to save life and property. These situations require a speedy response. So it is very crucial and important to establish direct, fast and efficient technique without delay. Artificial intelligence may help us to solve this real life challenge. Patient, Fire brigade office, Hospitals, Police Traffic congestion has grown to an alarming event in major cities across India. Ambulance Driver will select route to reach hospital. System will automatically control traffic light based on population of vehicle and based on priority on that route. (Controls entire area surrounding route). Other features like Ambulance arrival indication to surrounding vehicle will give extra benefit. Emergency vehicle will be able to reach at the destination in time. If emergency vehicle is ambulance, patient will get treatment in time. Iif emergency vehicle is fire fighting equipment it will be able to control fire. If emergency vehicle is police van, it will be able to control crime. Vehicular traffic is endlessly increasing everywhere in the world and can cause terrible traffic congestion at intersections. This solution will allow emergency vehicle to get route during emergency situations. Traffic congestion and tidal flow are major facts that cause delay to ambulance.The loss of human life due to accident and delay in getting proper treatment must be avoided. In order to save human life from accidents and unnecessary delay due to traffic congestion will be avoided due to this solution and it will help to save precious human life.As cameras are deployed on most of the signals today, Computer Vision can be used for vehicle count and will be stored and updated in a steaming manner. This will thus help create effective algorithms to alter the time of the traffic signals based on this real time vehicle count, also by making sure that the traffic congestions doesnt increase exponentially and multiple emergency vehicles does not put the system in a deadlock.|

|During recent years, due to the technological advancements many sophisticated techniques has been evolved for assuring fast recovery of the patients in hospitals. Need for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is the most fundamental thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible for monitoring the electrolyte’s bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule.To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery Hospital uses simple electrolytes bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to patient because the reverse flow will start, blood start to flow from body towards bottle. In, Hospital ICU, CCU, NICU, OPD, OT, most of all department of hospital required such kind of automatic monitoring and indication system. Also Health care industries will one of the users. such monitoring system can be useful in small , medium and large size of hospitals and also it useful during home care. If such a monitoring system builds, it will decrease the chances of patients hazards and increases the accuracy of health care in hospital. In future we can design a ready mate portable cover system for such bottle. Ready mate Wearable sensors on sides of bottle can detect level/weight of-fluid inside bottles. Such data can also send to nurses and/or doctor`s mobile and they can start or stop the fluid and also monitoring fluid condition, such things required security password also. Hospital staff, the constant need to manually monitor the level of bottles is avoided. This is of high advantage to the patients especially during night times. This system also avoids the fatal risk of air bubbles entering the patient’s bloodstream, which is a serious threat as air bubbles in blood can cause immediate death. Such a device will create assurity of non-harm condition to patients. and also helpful to monitoring of data and such data can be stored and will be useful in future.|

|India has vast length of roads within cities, towns and villages. Also connected to them are the national highways (total length of national highways being about 1.3 million km). Most of the streets are illuminated from evening to morning averaging about 12 hours per day within the habitations. It is well understood that some of the streets may not have vehicles or even pedestrians passing through them throughout the night. In such scenarios there is wastage of electrical energy for illumination of streets. Smart street light management would mean that sensors can sense a movement in an area and switch on the lights before the vehicle or pedestrian passes by and switch it off during no movement thus saving electrical energy.|
