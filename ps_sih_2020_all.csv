BEML Limited,AK210,1,Design of Energy Efficient Regenerative Hydraulic System for 100 Ton Excavator,"An excavator is a construction vehicle used to excavate or move large objects. The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement.
The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm & bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick.  The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel  joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. 
Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM's.
When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available. A new regeneration scheme to recover these energies to reduce the power loss and energy /fuel saving. The total potential energy could be regenerated under the standard operating conditions in the proposed system should be more energy efficient at least 30~40% of existing system.
Outcome expected: 
1.	Propose alternative Design for energy efficient Regenerative Hydraulic system for 100 ton Excavator.
2.	Alternative concept and features should meet or exceed the hydraulic system efficiency of  current hydraulic system.
3.	Concept needs to be described with block diagram and working principle indicating regeneration of hydraulic energy to be described in hydraulic system line diagram.
4.	The proposed energy regeneration system to be verified through simulation result which is done in AMESim / Simulink or any other software.
5.	Need to explain the functional block model, methodology, Algorithm and flow chart used.
6.	The proposed energy recovery system and control strategy should improve energy recovery efficiency and optimize working performance of the system. 
7.	Proposed regenerative hydraulic circuit to be simulated at various operating conditions.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC87,3,Network routing protocol for infrastructure less gateway devices in man-made emergency situations.,"In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualized MANET protocol shall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node in searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zones such as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in the area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed to modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol. The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establishment and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be in order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devices shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used. An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.

APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.,"Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) is a statutory organization entrusted to implement Environmental Laws and control pollution in the state of Andhra Pradesh through regulations.

APPCB is presently using cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.

As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring. 

APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.

Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.

Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.

Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of Non-Attainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC86,5,Fiducial localization for pre-operative planning in neurosurgery,"Preoperative planning is a phase before actual surgery procedure in which the surgeon can take all the time needed to define the surgical problem, to identify fully all the anatomical and technical aspects of the procedure, and then carefully plan the solution. In order to facilitate this, the patient is assumed to be located in a coordinate system refered to as the ‘Patient Coordinate System’(PCS), whereas the surgeon has access to pre-operative medical scans(like CT/MRI etc.) of the subject in the coordinate system refered to as the ‘Image Coordinate System’(ICS). Any procedure planned in medical scans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping. The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration) between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of the surgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use of special markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICS mapping. Apart from establishing correspondances between the appearance of fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas and accurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducials or utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. The goal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm for detection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, the participants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on the skull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center of these fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC89,5,Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls,"Steel is a widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipment in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipment may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires de-assembling, inspection and then re-assembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like X-Rays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken. Solution methodology - Light waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology. As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound. Final outcome -  A set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it. Challenges - Since wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less. It will be very difficult to detect and differentiate the sound signal obtained from the objects.

Cognizant Technology Solutions India Pvt. Ltd,MS452,7,"Designing devices, which would help in easing communication channels between various communication devices and points.","A truly digital public transportation system for buses, trains and feeder services

Explain the general problem statement in simple terms. 
v)	As the population in city grows multifold year on year the commuting times continue to grow. Whether you commute by train (metro/non-metro), bus, smart bike or on feeder services there is no one stop shop for planning your trip using public transport facilities.
vi)	With raising traffic both road and rail, there is no mechanism to track the arrival / departure times, shift between different modes of transport etc.
vii)	Today, the user of public transport facility has to shift between two modes of transport on an average (a train and a bus / a bus and a feeder service to the nearby work location). The uncertainty of when these services are available and how crowded it would be makes it hard plan the trip accordingly. 
viii)	From a government point of view, without knowing the demand at various times, it makes it hard for them to increase / decrease these services for full utilization. Hence, it is important to gauge the demand.

The users of this system are two-fold:
User / Traveler: An end user who uses the public transport services to plan a trip;
Government Authorities: Assess and provide the services according to the need of the users and manage the services based on the demand.

Technology that can address this issue
iv)	A unified system that brings all modes of public transport data into a single source of truth.
v)	A mobile app and website for end users to plan and book travel across multiple public transport facilities railways, bus, metro and feeder services.
vi)	GPS sensors on buses, trains, feeder services where feasible and processing capability
vii)	Payments interface to enable direct payment for the entire trip (that can be scanned for validity at the public transport being used)

Technology platform recommendation 
i)	A cloud database with extensible features
ii)	A distributed database with scalability features 
iii)	Microservice orchestration platform for API integration ( Maps, regional data )  
iv)	On cloud UX for creating a native App
v)	Leverage SMS API gateway
vi)	Leverage ready apps from Azure or AWS 

An example comparison of these services: 
In the UK you can manage all the local commute using the railways using “National Rail” app. This App is a one-stop-shop for users for both trains, London metro tubes, buses etc. An user can plan end to end services using this App. 

For our idea, some of the key customer journeys envisaged using this are.
i)	Fetch schedule times of the buses / trains / feeder services individually
ii)	Book your journey
iii)	Bar code based identification of tickets purchased
iv)	Real time tracking of your service (bus / train) and identify the ETA to reach your destination
v)	Set up alerts for your service
vi)	Send notifications based on channel of choice (SMS / App notifications)

Desired Outcome: 
iv)	User
a.	Provide a seamless, one-stop, end-to-end experience when planning any trip
b.	Show all available options to the user from which he can pick which ones he prefers
c.	No waiting queue at the availed service facility. 
d.	Make bookings/reservations within this service and pay in total the entire amount
v)	Government
a.	Promote/boost railways, state bus transport corporations, sub-urban railway, metro
b.	In the long run, this service can replace state wise bus transport reservation websites with a single website/app leading to huge cost savings
c.	Additional source of revenue in the form of small commission amounts per transaction
d.	Provide a major source of data as the service becomes more popular which can help the Govt. to plan for roads/railways/infrastructure development in the future
e.	Help more transport based entrepreneurs and small businesses to bring their services to the public faster",Hardware,Smart Communication,,

Government of Andhra Pradesh,KB141,9,"Design State Research Portal, a single point securely hosted solution to seamlessly integrate search and manage all the research activities","The act of research sets the course for the development of any product or service. Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. 

In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:
a.	Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). 
b.	Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. 

A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. 

c.	Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC85,11,Laser based Vibration Sensor operated through mobile,"Vibration detection plays an important role in the different areas of structural health monitoring and industrial engineering. If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.
Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts 
I.	Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate ±5V output corresponding to ±5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.
II.	An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.
Thus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement. Then development of suitable Android based  mobile app to communicate to the sensor and display frequency spectrum and important vibration parameters on mobile screen.",Hardware,Smart Communication,,

A large amount of money is going to waste due to irregularity and improper approach. Sound asset management principles need to be introduced as an integral part of road policies and maintenance program. Comprehensive maintenance planning with schedule,institutional reforms, linkage with initial construction, maintenance backlog, utilization of fund, regular on site inspections, training to the workforce, human attitude, existing practices and knowledge of different road patterns are the major challenges in record-keeping. The maintenance and record keeping of maintenance is the key issues in the government department after the liability period over of new construction. A comprehensive system will help for planning of maintenance schedule, frame work, methodology. Also a prediction can be made for the timely maintenance fund requirements. Effective techniques can be decided for the problems. Quality of initial construction work can be achieved. It is more important to say that wastage of public fund can be reduced from the repetitive approach. Mostly, Public infrastructure is developed by the government department. It is obvious that various government bodies like municipalities, nagarpalika, panchayat and road and building department of state and central government etc. will be the potential users. Also private residential and commercial communities may use it for the maintenance records and fund estimation. A comprehensive maintenance record-keeping system will be the ready tool, which serve different aspects of complete qualitative maintenance such as, data base of complete any type of inspection on-site, recording defects including capture of images and location data to aid in repair, repair methodology applied, cost of maintenance, effective area of work, frequency of maintenance including during liability period of new constructions and fund planning for the future. It will be fruitful for the executors for social and economic development of users. Effective maintenance record keeping system will create social and economic impacts of rural roads users. It will serves ready record for long term budget planning as huge investment incurred in road infrastructure development. Some qualitative outputs such as, maintained roads provide access to where people live and important facilities such as markets, schools and health services.

There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.",Hardware,Smart Vehicles,,
MathWorks,AG343,18,"Renewable Energy forecasting, for an integrated smart grid","BACKGROUND:
Advances in technology have enabled large-scale harnessing of sources of renewable energy (solar, wind etc.).  Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables real-time demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed.  Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management.  For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast.  Literature proposes various learning-based forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demand-supply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1.	Simulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers.
2.	For the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forums-develop energy generation forecasting models. 
3.	For the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forums-develop energy demand forecasting models. 
4.	Develop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller.
5.	Integrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1.
6.	Prototype the following use case with developed models: 
An Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time. The manager will require a dashboard that provides a micro- and macroscopic spatio-temporal trend of: (a) consumer demand maps; (b) prosumer supply; (c) solar/wind energy generated; (d) conventional energy generated; (e) outages; (f) accuracies of forecasting models for energy demand and energy generated (conventional and renewable); (g) scheduling decision report.

OUTCOME EXPECTED:
1.	A microgrid simulation model (with scheduling strategy integrated at controller).
2.	Forecasting models to predict demand, renewable energy generated. (possibly Statistical/Machine Learning models).
3.	Scheduling strategy/algorithm to manage resources to meet demands. (optimization algorithm based on forecasting model of demand and generation).
4.	A web-application of the dashboard with appropriate visualizations and reports.

•	Un-availability of real time data from wind turbines 
•	Delayed detection of mechanical and structural faults 
•	Delayed order placements of spares/replacements 
•	Reliance on manual inspection of every turbine 
The users of this system are two-fold:
The distribution utility manager wants to monitor all the electrical wind turbine /transformers, so that he can maximize the turbine power generation. He wanted to track the real time health of all parts of turbine including generator, blades etc., live parameters monitored such as wind direction , temperature, current, voltage etc. on a geographical map, so that he can assign a repair crew member to resolve the issue on the open notification. 

The manager also wants to know the historical information to all the parameters being monitored to analyze the root cause of the failure and to predict the future outages. He also wants analytical dashboards which helps in the decision making process. However, the manager wants to make his decisions as per the smart data available i.e. live sensor data, historical sensor data, device metadata 
Technology that can address this issue partially.
SAP Leonardo with S/4 Digital Core 

Since SAP Leonardo site on top of S/4 HANA, it easily integrates with S/4 Digital Core so that it will start reading Wind Turbine real time sensor data at one side and processing business transactions and applications at other. SAP Leonardo enables users to receive instant notifications of any failure events happening at Turbine Tower. 
When any issue rises such as oil leakage or break down, Leonardo will search for extra available spare part from S/4 Digital Core’s Warehouse Management Component. 

 

If a spare part exists in the S/4 warehouse, Leonardo will process a PTO (Pick Transfer Order) and assign a work order to nearest technician to a tower using his/her GPS coordinates. A technician will pick up the spare part from warehouse and fix the turbine issue. 
In case if Leonardo does not find spare part in S/4 Warehouse Component, it will automatically place a Purchase Order to a Vendor and maintain its record in a custom Z table. 
Once a factory user performs a GR (Goods Receive) for spare part through SAP t-code MIGO, Leonardo will check its existence in custom created Z table & if found, it will automatically create and assign a new work order to a technician. 
This integrated automation will drastically save time for troubleshooting & maximize the Turbine Power generation

Desired Outcome: 
•	Cost efficiency in maintaining and servicing wind turbines 
•	Immediate order placement in case of inventory exhaustion. 
•	To maintain the desired power output from wind farm to grid 
•	Maximize the Turbine Power Generation 
•	Real time insights of mechanical failures in wind turbines 
•	Data Analysis of downtime and its causes 
•	Pattern analysis thereby enabling better forecast",Hardware,Sustainable Environment,,

Traffic control for the people, by the people”. The smart phone-based Application captures the traffic flout and directly share it with traffic control team. App will have information about Traffic rules with best user interactive appearance. App will reduce Burden on traffic control team.  

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The traffic is huge problem in metro cities in India and to monitor it throughout a day it’s the difficult task. The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.

Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd.,AN418,31,"Robotic Arm for inspection, cleaning and painting of tanks on ships to save on time, cost and avoid accidents.","(a)	Statement of the Problem. 

Ships use fuel, oils, sludge, sewage, water and other fluids, which are stored in tanks. When stored in tanks, these fluids tend to stick inside the tanks forming layers of semi-solid substance. Moreover, many impurities of these fluids settle down and stick to the surface of the tanks. It is therefore imperative that the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis on ships.
Generally, tanks cleaning on the ship is done during dry dock and whenever the inspection of the tanks is due. Cleaning is done for inspection or if there is any work to be done inside the tanks such as cracks, leaks, etc.
Tank cleaning inspection and repairs is a necessary procedure performed on board ships. This process, when carried out by humans, tends to be hazardous, sometimes leading to explosion and accidents. In spite of all the necessary safety precautions and enclosed space entry procedures, accidents still occur while inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks on board ships.

(b)	How it is being Overcome.

The problem is, at present, being overcome by ventilating the tanks and use of personnel protective gears. However, the atmosphere in the tanks still remains unsatisfactory and continues to pose health hazards for human beings.

The following procedure is followed before making an entry for tank cleaning: -
•	Fluid Contents of the tank should be removed as practicable as possible and stripped thoroughly before entering.
•	Ventilate the tank using thorough ventilation or forced ventilation method and make the tank suitable for man entry.
•	Before making a man entry, the atmosphere of the tank is tested for percentage of oxygen and availability of any toxic gases. This has to be done using remote access if possible, otherwise the person entering the tank for testing atmosphere must wear a breathing apparatus.
•	Various levels and compartments of tank is tested for the percentage of oxygen and availability of toxic gases. A multi gas analyser is used and a person who is trained and has the knowledge of using such equipment carries out the inspection.
Once the tank is found safe for man entry, workers enter the tank and carry out cleaning, inspection, repairs etc. Working within these constrained spaces is hazardous, in spite of all the safety precautions.
4.	Why it is Important to Solve.  

Effective solution of this problem is critical to avoid 
(a)	time delays in inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks 
(b)	accidents which still occur inside the tanks on board ships. 
(c)	manpower cost.

5.	Suggested Solutions. 

The problem can be resolved by developing a mechanism like a robotic arm with the following attachments:
(a)	Gas analyser for checking the percentage of oxygen and presence of toxic gases, 
(b)	Camera for inspection of tank and examination of defect.
(c)	Cleaning Attachment
(d)	Repair attachments
(e)	Quality Inspection Equipment

The robotic arm should be amenable for reliable operation on a ship and capable of entering the tanks and reaching all areas within. It should have programmable operations like horizontal movement, vertical movement, speed adjustment, single or multistage operation at any desired length and angle range, etc. It should be light enough to carry within the constraints of a ship, with fixing arrangements that match with arrangements on-board ship.",Hardware,Robotics & Drones,,

Following are the two main use cases (but not limited to)
1. Anyone can ask/look up for any information to IPM. It responds with accurate answer by voice-to-text-conversion/email. Mining existing data (could use APIs of the information hosting applications). Co-relating multiple information, analyzes and respond text-to-voice/email.
2. Take the Speaker in a meeting (example: scrum ceremonies/meetings). It records the meeting MOM in detail in its own data-reservoir (database). The scrum master can also instruct IPM to do multiple activity during the meeting. Say: Create a jira task, pull out the last updated jira task. Send me the last email from XYZ to me etc.

To implement this, you can use a computer/speak/mail server and client, Voice-text-voice converter, text to jira / confluence / bitbucket / Stack Overflow APIs, AI to Analyze data to get accurate information, ML to learn when taken in a meeting. 
The key challenges in the problem would be to architect an information store that is optimally designed to answer queries, and accurately answer questions posed to it. For voice to text, and text to voice, you may use standard (free) libraries/services available in the market.",Software,Smart Communication,https://youtu.be/N3rDIHNK1u0,https://youtu.be/N3rDIHNK1u0

Cisco DEVNET,AM289,36,Atithi Devo Bhava,"Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces.

Solution Expected: 

The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism.
1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system.
2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger.

Tech recommendation:  
The Conversational AI Playbook can be integrated with Webex Teams and help tourists in
the following key areas like
Travel Planner – The Chatbot must act as a virtual travel agent who is able to share the suggestions based on the users travel preferences.
It should be capable to check the Hotel Room Availability
Recommend the right package based on tourist profile.
Keep tourist informed about the details of the journey like check ins, flight /Train status etc.
Route complex queries to human agents in real time (Adventure Tourism)

The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria:

Department of Atomic Energy,PC88,40,Generalized Epileptic Seizure Alert System,"Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Of the 70 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide, nearly 12 million PWE are expected to reside in India; which contributes to nearly one-sixth of the global burden. Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation. Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost, portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family members or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn’t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures. The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body. The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions, continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.",Hardware,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,,

Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day.

GE Healthcare,UP49,70,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data,"The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.
Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).
Abstract
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.
Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/",Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,,

Education department Gujarat,AD362,79,Traffic Clearance for Ambulance/(or other priority Vehicle) through Artificial Intelligence,"Traffic is the most critical problem in major cities in India. Sometimes emergency vehicle does not get route to reach at the destination due to heavy congestion on the road. Even if its desired, driver or owner of vehicle is in such a crucial position that he/she can not give space to such emergency vehicle. Emergency vehicle may be ambulance or fire-fighting equipment carrying vehicle, police van or disaster management vehicle. In emergency situation, vehicle should reach in time at proper destination but unfortunately traffic situation block that vehicle. In emergency situation like severe heat attack, pregnancy , accident, fire etc. it is necessary for a vehicle to reach at the destination in short time. In medical emergency, it is necessary to provide emergency medical treatment to the patient. It is necessary to reach at nearest and best hospital in time. Most of cities and even district place are having problem of traffic and due to which ambulance and other emergency vehicles are not getting free route to reach at the destination. Other Emergency occurs anywhere at any location, at any time, and in various ways will make one at risk such as fire. Fire fighting vehicle must reach in time to save life and property. These situations require a speedy response. So it is very crucial and important to establish direct, fast and efficient technique without delay. Artificial intelligence may help us to solve this real life challenge. Patient, Fire brigade office, Hospitals, Police Traffic congestion has grown to an alarming event in major cities across India. Ambulance Driver will select route to reach hospital. System will automatically control traffic light based on population of vehicle and based on priority on that route. (Controls entire area surrounding route). Other features like Ambulance arrival indication to surrounding vehicle will give extra benefit. Emergency vehicle will be able to reach at the destination in time. If emergency vehicle is ambulance, patient will get treatment in time. Iif emergency vehicle is fire fighting equipment it will be able to control fire. If emergency vehicle is police van, it will be able to control crime. Vehicular traffic is endlessly increasing everywhere in the world and can cause terrible traffic congestion at intersections. This solution will allow emergency vehicle to get route during emergency situations. Traffic congestion and tidal flow are major facts that cause delay to ambulance.The loss of human life due to accident and delay in getting proper treatment must be avoided. In order to save human life from accidents and unnecessary delay due to traffic congestion will be avoided due to this solution and it will help to save precious human life.As cameras are deployed on most of the signals today, Computer Vision can be used for vehicle count and will be stored and updated in a steaming manner. This will thus help create effective algorithms to alter the time of the traffic signals based on this real time vehicle count, also by making sure that the traffic congestions doesnt increase exponentially and multiple emergency vehicles does not put the system in a deadlock.",Hardware,Smart Cities,,

Need for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is the most fundamental thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible for monitoring the electrolyte’s bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule.To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery Hospital uses simple electrolytes bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to patient because the reverse flow will start, blood start to flow from body towards bottle.
